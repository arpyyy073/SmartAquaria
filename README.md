Smart Aquarium Capstone Project

This project is a Capstone Project focused on building a Smart Aquarium System using various sensors and actuators to automate and monitor the aquatic environment.

Components Used

- Turbidity Sensor – Measures water clarity
- pH Level Sensor – Monitors water acidity/alkalinity
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor – Measures water temperature
- Servo Motor – Controls automatic fish feeding
- Submersible Pump Motor – Manages water change system

Features

- Wi-Fi Configuration – Easily connect to any Wi-Fi using captive portal
- App-Controlled Feeding – Trigger fish feeding through the mobile app
- App-Controlled Water Change – Remotely activate water cycling system
